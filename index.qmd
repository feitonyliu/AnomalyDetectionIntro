-   Anomaly detection is the process of identifying patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior.

-   The definition of an anomaly is that it is unusual (or not normal).

    -   This definition is super-helpful (sarcasm)!

-   Formal definition "Anomaly detection refers to the problem of finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior." [@chandola2009anomaly]

-   Enrich your knowledge: Anomaly Detection is one of main branches of Data Mining, beside Supervised Learning, Clustering and Association Rules.

A simple example of anomalies in a 2-dimensional dataset.
$N_1$ and $N_1$ are normal regions. $o_1$ and $o_2$ are points that are sufficiently far away from these regions.  $o_3$ are clustered anomalies. 

#### Examples of real-life anomalies:

* Credit card frauds
* Insurance frauds
* Cyber-intrusions 
* Terrorist activities
* System breakdowns

## Challenges of Anomaly Detection
* Defining a normal region which encompasses every possible normal behavior is very difficult.
* The Masking and Swamping problems - Anoamlies are hidding among normal points or increase their frequency to appear like normal points.
* The concept draft problem - normal/anomaly behavior keeps evolving.
* The notions of anomaly are different for different applications.
* Availability of labelled data is a major issue - for training/validation of models.
* Often data naturally contains noise, which are very similar to anomalies. [@chandola2009anomaly]
