## Introduction

-   Anomaly detection is the process of identifying patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior.

-   The definition of an anomaly is that it is unusual (or not normal).

    -   This definition is super-helpful (sarcasm)!

-   Formal definition "Anomaly detection refers to the problem of finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior." [@chandola2009anomaly]

-   Business Opportunity: Australiaâ€™s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing reform is coming soon...
    -   System Modernization
    -   Scope to include trench 2 entries (real estate professionals, lawyers, accountants, trust and company service providers)
-   Enrich your knowledge: Anomaly Detection is one of main branches of Data Mining, beside Supervised Learning, Clustering and Association Rules.

A simple example of anomalies in a 2-dimensional dataset. $N_1$ and $N_1$ are normal regions. $o_1$ and $o_2$ are points that are sufficiently far away from these regions. $O_3$ are clustered anomalies.

#### Examples of real-life anomalies:

-   Credit card frauds
-   Insurance frauds
-   Cyber-intrusions
-   Terrorist activities
-   System breakdowns

## Challenges of Anomaly Detection

-   **Defining a normal region is very difficult,** because it needs to encompass every possible normal behaviors.
-   **The Masking and Swamping problems** - Anoamlies are harder to be detected when hidding among normal points or increase their frequency to appear like normal points.
-   **The concept draft problem** - normal/anomaly behavior keeps evolving.
-   **The notions of anomaly are not the same** in different applications.
-   **Availability of labelled data is a major issue** - for training/validation of models.
-   **Often data naturally contains noise**, which are very similar to anomalies, making them harder to be detected. [@chandola2009anomaly]

-   **Robust Covariance** (Statistical Based) fits a gaussian distribution to the dataset.

-   **One-Class SVM** (Classification Based) generalizes a hyperplane from the data for a decision boundary that include as much data points as possible.

-   **Isolation Forest** (Isolation Based) builds multiple randomly generated binary trees from sample of the data. Points having short pathlength are anomalies.

-   **Local Outlier Factor** (Nearest Neighbour Based) calculates pairwise distance in order to find points that have higher local outlier factor as anomalies.
